# Project03-JuicyBreakout

# Project Name
Made 02/24/24 in Unity v. 2022.3.17f 

A somewhat silly space-themed brick breaker game where your main goal is to destroy all the bricks you can.

## Implementation
# Features
* Paddle and ball change colors upon impact with elements (done via DO tweening)
* Ball squeezes and stretches with rapid movement and collision
* Screen shake
* Fun sound effects when a brick is broken, the ball collides with the paddle, and when player loses a life
* Added background music
* Particles emit from paddle upon collision with the ball
* When broken, bricks fall off the screen
* Bricks break when hit
* Ball has a delayed comet trail
* Engaging backgrounds
* Eyes on the paddle that follow the ball
* Cute little smiley face on paddle (purely cosmetic)
